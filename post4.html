	<section id="blog">
			<p>With only 100 days left until the New Year, it’s hard to believe how fast this year has flown by. Funny enough, I’ve managed to be both the most productive and the most unproductive in the same year. I’ve failed countless times, almost gave up on myself, and then got back up to chase my purpose, making genuine progress along the way.</p>
    <br>

    <p>For you, this year might have been filled with happiness, struggles, or a mix of both. But if you commit to using these last 100 days effectively, you can make substantial progress in your life. This post will provide a protocol that you can use to make the most of this time. In fact, you can apply this protocol for any duration by adjusting the timeline, but 100 days is a solid stretch to aim for real progress.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>The Protocol for Progress</h2>

    <p>This protocol includes performing good habits, cutting out bad habits, and focusing on clear goals. You’ll find the protocol in full detail in the description below, but there are some key steps to understand before diving in:</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Step 1: Set Two Main Goals</h3>

    <p>Choose two main goals you want to achieve over the next 100 days. Make these goals as specific and detailed as possible so you know exactly what you’re aiming to accomplish. Then, break these goals down into monthly, weekly, and daily targets, along with specific habits that will help you get there.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Step 2: Track Your Habits and Progress</h3>

    <p>Create a habit tracker on paper or digitally to keep tabs on your good habits and ensure you’re moving toward your goals daily. Set bare minimum requirements for the habits and actions you’ll perform each day, so you can still make progress on difficult days. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection.</p>
    <br>

    <p>I’ve included a list of daily action items and minimum requirements in the description below to help you stay consistent. Just be careful not to let these minimums become an excuse to avoid putting in real effort. Use them as a baseline, not a limit.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Step 3: Commit to Your Goals and Push Your Limits</h3>

    <p>Over these next 100 days, focus relentlessly on your goals and the positive habits you’ve set. Push through laziness and a weak mindset. Continuously challenge your capabilities while maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Make becoming the best version of yourself your top priority.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Join the Accountability Discord</h2>

    <p>I’ve created a Discord chat where I’ll be sharing my own daily habits and goals. Join the Discord so we can hold each other accountable and make progress together, pushing to become the best versions of ourselves.</p>
    <br>

    <p>See you in the Discord, and here’s to making the most of these last 100 days! Peace.</p>
