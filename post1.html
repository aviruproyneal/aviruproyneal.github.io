				<section id="blog">
				<h1>Do You Want to Be Happier?</h1>
				<p>I mean, we all do, right? But nowadays, it seems the happiness levels among the people of our generation have been exponentially decreasing over the years. But why is that? When we all are trying to be happier, it’s not possible to be happy all the time—life is full of ups and downs. However, we can definitely ensure that we stay relatively happier and more optimistic throughout the majority of our lives.</p>
				
				<p>Most of our generation is not happy due to one major reason: a lack of gratitude and appreciation. We often hear our older generation tell us that we do not appreciate what we have, and to some extent, they are telling the truth. In this age of social media, we are bombarded with the highlights of everyone’s life. It’s easy to psychologically feel like what we have is not enough and that we are the ones being dealt the wrong cards—when that couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>
				
			<br><p>You and I, as a generation, have opportunities and privileges that our predecessors never had. So, let me tell you about one habit that will guarantee an increase in your happiness and optimism in the long run: <strong>gratitude journaling</strong>.</p>

		    <br><h2>The Power of Gratitude Journaling</h2>
				<p>It’s scientifically proven that gratitude journaling can boost our overall happiness levels. So, what is gratitude journaling? It simply involves writing down a few things you’re grateful for every day.</p>

				<p><em>But Neal, I don’t have many things to be grateful about.</em> Shut up, man! Yes, you do. Aren’t you breathing? You’re alive and healthy, right? Many people around the world lose their lives every single day, while many who are alive aren’t healthy. They would give anything to have the good health you and I enjoy.</p>

				<br><p>Be grateful for that! You have your arms and legs, right? Your organs are functioning properly—be grateful for that! Many people have recently lost an arm or a leg and would do anything to get it back. You have a roof over your head, food on your plate, good clothes to wear, and a safe environment to live in. Be grateful for all that! Many people around the world dream of having the things we take for granted.</p>

				<br><p>It’s extremely important that we are grateful for even the smallest things in life. Developing the habit of gratitude journaling will help you immensely.</p>

				<br><h2>How to Start Gratitude Journaling</h2>
				<p><strong>Here are the steps:</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li><p>Write down a minimum of one thing you’re grateful for every day. If you want to write more than one, feel free to do so!</p></li>
					<li><p>Use pen and paper. Writing by hand is tangible and more impactful than typing it out digitally.</p></li>
					<li><p>Format your entries. Write down your gratitude in the following format: <em>“I’m grateful for X because Y,”</em> where X is what you’re grateful for, and Y is why you’re grateful for it.</p></li>
				</ol>

				<p>Let me share an example from my gratitude journal today: <em>“I’m grateful for my toothbrush because it helps me keep my mouth clean, allowing me to be hygienic and presentable to myself and everyone around me.”</em></p>

				<br><p>That might seem insignificant, right? But once you start doing this daily, you’ll begin to appreciate the smallest things in your life. Over time, you’ll even find yourself grateful for the struggles you’ve faced because they’ve only made you stronger.</p>

				<br><h2>A Disclaimer</h2>
				<p>Don’t expect quick results. Think of this habit as an investment in yourself for a happier future. I recommend performing this habit right after you wake up in the morning, as it will program your mind to think positive thoughts right from the start of the day. How amazing is that?</p>

				<br><h2>Additional Tips for Increasing Happiness</h2>
				<p>Here are more things you can do to enhance your overall happiness:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Go outside regularly.</li>
					<li>Socialize.</li>
					<li>Surround yourself with positive-minded people.</li>
				</ul>

				<br><p>If you incorporate these practices along with gratitude journaling, mark my words—your happiness and fulfillment in life will 10x in just a few months!</p>

				<br><h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>That’s it for this post! If you want to learn why chasing momentum and progress in life will get you much farther than chasing perfection, stay tuned for more insights.</p>
